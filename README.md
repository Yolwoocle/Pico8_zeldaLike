Includes source code and stuff, but **the repo is not organized**, and the code might be messy. We were not planning about long-term when we made this.  
To edit the code, the files you're looking for are:  
* [birds_with_guns_final_2.p8](https://github.com/Yolwoocle/birds_with_guns/blob/main/birds_with_guns_final_2.p8) for the cartridge
* [birds_with_guns_final_2.p8.png](https://github.com/Yolwoocle/birds_with_guns/blob/main/birds_with_guns_final_2.p8) for the PNG cart.  

You will need to own [PICO-8](https://pico-8.com/).  

All other files are either older versions or temporary test files we didn't delete.  

You can also find all the executables, but I have no idea which one corresponds to the version actually used on itch.io. If in doubt, just export it yourself. Do whatever the fuck want with it. If you want to do cool stuff with it, it's even encouraged!!
