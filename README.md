Includes source code and stuff, but **the repo is not organized**, and the code might be messy. We were not planning about long-term when we made this.  
To edit the code, the files you're looking for are:  
* [birds_with_guns_final_2.p8](https://github.com/Yolwoocle/birds_with_guns/blob/main/birds_with_guns_final_2.p8) for the cartridge
* [birds_with_guns_final_2.p8.png](https://github.com/Yolwoocle/birds_with_guns/blob/main/birds_with_guns_final_2.p8) for the PNG cart.  

You will need to own [PICO-8](https://pico-8.com/).  

All other files are either older versions or temporary test files we didn't delete.  

You can also find all the executables, but I have no idea which one corresponds to the version actually used on itch.io. If in doubt, just export it yourself. You can pirate my game, I genuinely don't give a fuck. If you want to do cool stuff with it, it's even encouraged!!

The code is under [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). Meaning you can **distribute and remix freely** this game, BUT you must: **credit us** somewhere, **not profit out of it**, and **keep the same license** when you do (basically, keep your remix under the same conditions I just mentionned). I added the second rule to prevent NFT companies to steal our game, because [of course it happened to us](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/indie-devs-outraged-by-unlicensed-game-sales-on-gamestops-nft-market/). If you are looking to make something commercial, please [email me first](https://yolwoocle.github.io/). I will probably say yes with no royalties!
